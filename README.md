# Plant Disease Detection Web Application

This web application allows users to upload images of plants and detect potential diseases present in the plants. It utilizes a machine learning model trained to recognize various plant diseases based on input images.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for uploading plant images
- Asynchronous prediction using AJAX to avoid page reload
- Display of prediction result in a visually appealing format

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 and CSS3 for the structure and styling of the web application
- Bootstrap 4 for responsive design and pre-styled components
- JavaScript for interactivity and AJAX requests
- jQuery for DOM manipulation and AJAX handling

## Getting Started

To run the plant disease detection web application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-disease-detection.git
```

2. Open the project directory:

```bash
cd plant-disease-detection
```

3. Launch the application:

- If you have a server-side implementation, configure the server environment and start the server.
- If you don't have a server-side implementation, you can use a local server for testing. One option is to use Python's built-in HTTP server. Run the following command:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

4. Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:8000` (or the appropriate server URL).

## Customization

- You can modify the HTML and CSS files to change the appearance and layout of the web application.
- Update the JavaScript code in `script.js` to handle the response from the prediction endpoint and customize the behavior as needed.
- Adapt the server-side implementation (not provided) to handle the image upload, perform the prediction using the machine learning model, and return the prediction result.
